## Unactualized Dream

Who are you truly?<br/>
The man you believe yourself to be,<br/>
Or the stranger in the mirror's gleam?<br/>
The son your mother cherishes still,<br/>
The wanderer expected home at will,<br/>
Or that desolate soul whose only friends<br/>
Are the hands that shield him from the wind?<br/>
<br/>
Are you the boy who lost it all,<br/>
Or mere illusions that rise and fall?<br/>
You dream of flight and walking seas,<br/>
Of boundless wealth and destinies—<br/>
Yes, you whisper, that's who I am.<br/>
But notice how a man becomes<br/>
Not what he shows, but what he dreams.<br/>
<br/>
All things seem possible to those<br/>
Who truly believe in what they were.<br/>
So who bears blame when dreams expose<br/>
Their hollow core? The dream that glows<br/>
Or he who chased its fading light?<br/>
The promise sweet, or willing fool?<br/>
The siren song, or one who heard?<br/>
<br/>
They say it's just a dream, but no—<br/>
Dreams push us past our boundaries,<br/>
Promise worlds we'll never know,<br/>
Paint impossible geometries,<br/>
Then leave us broken when they go.<br/>
<br/>
A dream's a cruel cartographer<br/>
Marking "roads less traveled by,"<br/>
Leading seekers far from home<br/>
Until they're lost beneath strange sky,<br/>
A shadow of their former selves.<br/>
<br/>
What is a dream but fragile hope?<br/>
A hypocrite in lover's clothes,<br/>
Who whispers sweet to countless souls<br/>
Then chooses one to rise above,<br/>
Leaving others far below.<br/>
<br/>
I should have listened, should have known:<br/>
Dreams are chosen, not imposed.<br/>
Why do we claim we're special ones<br/>
Only to become what we despise?<br/>
Why chase impossible horizons<br/>
When others saw the dangers clear?<br/>
<br/>
"To hell with consequences," pride declares,<br/>
While watching peers advance ahead.<br/>
A man enslaved to dreams, beware—<br/>
You'll sacrifice it all instead<br/>
For promises that turn to air.<br/>
<br/>
So who are you? A dreamer lost,<br/>
A soul deluded by the cost<br/>
Of chasing what can never be?<br/>
The path ahead forks endlessly—<br/>
Choose wisely which shall set you free.<br/>
