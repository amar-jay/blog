## Unfulfilled Dream

Who are you,
the man you claim to be,
or the one staring back from the glass?
Are you the son your mother still calls for,
the one waiting to return,
or the soul alone in the quiet of his own hands?
The boy who lost more than time,
or the shadows that flicker in your mind?
Is this all that you are—
a mirage of someone you've yet to meet?

Am I the man who soars,
defying gravity,
walking on the surface of oceans,
the richest in spirit,
the rarest in kind?
Once, I believed I was that man—
the dream I wore,
the version of me I dared to create.
But I've learned,
it’s not what a man shows
but what he believes deep within
that shapes his truth.

So, who carries the weight?
Is it the dream,
the echo of something greater,
or the man who listens,
believing too strongly in its call?
The dream promises more than it can give,
the man, willing to give all he has—
to what? A phantom future?
A fleeting vision of grandeur?
The dream lifts with soft hands,
but what of the man left to bow?

They say it's "just a dream,"
but dreams—they haunt,
they push a man to become
something he isn’t,
offering impossible worlds,
only to leave him hollow when they fade.
A dream can leave a man in pieces,
a goodbye whispered by a ghost of possibility.

What is a dream but fragile hope?
A lover who promises more than can be delivered,
an abstract of what could be,
dragging one forward while the rest are left behind?
I wish I’d known—
I wish I’d seen through the haze
and chosen a different road.

It’s said it's "just a dream."
But why, then, does a man choose
to believe in something so unreal,
only to be crushed beneath its weight?
A dream isn’t forced; it’s chosen,
but why choose one that can destroy?
A man has the power to decide,
to stay grounded in what is real,
but too often, he chases an illusion
just to see others soar ahead.

And so, who are you?
A dreamer lost in a fragile hope,
or a man who stands,
unbroken,
choosing the path that keeps him whole?
The choice is yours,
but remember:
the road less traveled
is often the one that leads back to yourself.
