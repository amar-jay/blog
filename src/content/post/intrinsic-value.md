# Valuation of risk

Investment in the stock market has had a rough ride over the past 15 years. During the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 index had more than tripled in value to an all-time high of almost 1500. Previously unknowns, Amazon and AOL became the stock market superstars. And when the stock market crashed, many lesser stars flickered out. After 2003, the stocks recovered to a stunning pace, and by 2007, the S&P 500 had regained its all-time high, However, the market crashed again in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis, losing about half its value in the course of a few months.

We've started to question where long-held valuation theories can explain such dramatic changes in share prices. Some even assert the stock market lives a different life outside the realities of economic growth and business profitability. Others on the other hand, generally view the stock market and the representation of the entire economy. Irrespective of these opposing views, the fact that the general economy shaped by inflation rates, interest rates, growth in gross domestic product (GDP), and corporate profits can pose effects on the stock market remains true and the fundamental laws remain unchanged over the long term. For instance, despite one-or-two shortcomings, discounted cash flow has proven impressive results over the long term for most stocks. Additionally, the correlation between the return on invested capital (ROIC) and long-term growth tends to be impressively high.

However, to what extent does risk assessment play a role? In numerous well-known financial crises, a crucial factor appears to be the underestimation of risk. In the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, there was a significant overvaluation of high-risk, long-term assets (such as housing) portrayed as short-term securities. Despite initial perceptions of promise in certain stocks, when accounting for associated risks, the intrinsic value was substantially diminished, approaching near-zero levels.

Thus, the question remains: Is there a definitive formula for incorporating risk entirely into the determination of a stock's intrinsic value? Do not get me wrong; the valuation of a stock involves the consideration of numerous factors. Metrics such as volatility, debt-equity ratio, risk-adjusted return, and the Sharpe ratio offer insights into the impact of risk, but none of these metrics provides a comprehensive measurement or valuation of risk itself. These metrics provide insights into different dimensions of risk, such as market risk, financial risk, and liquidity risk.

The challenge lies in understanding how to effectively assess the value of risk, whether treated as an independent metric or as a ratio relative to a stock's intrinsic value. The subjective nature of risk assessments makes it difficult to represent risk as a singular, tangible figure in financial statements.
Current accounting standards, although requiring disclosure of certain risks, often fall short of providing a comprehensive picture, leaning towards risk-free portrayals.

I believe than black swan financial events are an accumulation of minute unaccounted-for factors. such as these. The intangible nature of risk plays a factor in these unforeseen occurrences.. The crux of the matter then becomes: How can we accurately and comprehensively evaluate risk?
