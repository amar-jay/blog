## What Is RISC-V?

RISC-V (pronounced ‚Äúrisk-five‚Äù) is an **open standard for instruction sets**, meaning anyone can use its specifications to design their own processors‚Äîwithout paying royalties or licensing fees. It‚Äôs like giving engineers a blank canvas and letting them create processors for everything from microcontrollers to high-end servers.

However, there‚Äôs often confusion around RISC-V‚Äôs openness. While its instruction set is free, the actual chip designs can be proprietary. Many companies keep their RISC-V designs closed, but open-source implementations are available for those who want to tinker or build.

The organization **RISC-V International** oversees the standard, manages branding, and fosters development. However, they don‚Äôt design chips themselves‚Äîthis responsibility lies with member companies like SiFive, Alibaba, and others.

## Modular Design: RISC-V‚Äôs Superpower

RISC-V‚Äôs architecture is **modular** by design, offering unmatched flexibility. Companies can start with one of its base modules and customize them with various extensions or even create proprietary ones. This flexibility has made RISC-V attractive across industries, though it has also led to some fragmentation.

### RISC-V Base and Extension Modules

## Where Is RISC-V Making an Impact?

### **1. Academia**

RISC-V‚Äôs simplicity makes it ideal for teaching assembly language and CPU design. It‚Äôs quickly becoming the go-to architecture in classrooms.

### **2. Embedded Systems**

This is where RISC-V shines today. Companies are adopting it for microcontrollers and IoT devices due to its low cost and flexibility. Even big names like NVIDIA and Apple reportedly use RISC-V cores in their products, though they don‚Äôt advertise it.

### **3. AI Hardware**

AI startups and giants alike are turning to RISC-V for its modular design. Many customize RISC-V cores with their own extensions, like low-precision matrix multiplication for neural networks.

### **4. Consumer Devices**

RISC-V is slowly catching up to ARM and x86 in consumer tech. Profiles like **RVA22** and **RVA23** aim to support Linux and Android, bringing RISC-V closer to powering everything from smartphones to PCs.

## The SHD Group: Bold Projections for RISC-V

The **SHD Group**, a prominent consulting and market analysis firm in the semiconductor industry, has been closely monitoring the rise of RISC-V. Known for their detailed forecasts and strategic insights, the SHD Group has outlined some intriguing projections about the future of RISC-V in the global market.

### **1. Explosive Growth in Market Share**

SHD Group predicts that RISC-V will achieve **double-digit market share** in the global semiconductor industry by 2030. This growth is fueled by:

- **Adoption in Embedded Systems**: RISC-V's modularity and low cost make it a perfect fit for microcontrollers and IoT devices, two of the fastest-growing segments in the tech industry.
- **Growing Presence in Data Centers**: Companies like Alibaba and SpacemiT are deploying RISC-V-based processors in cloud environments, where scalability and cost-effectiveness are crucial.

### **2. Competition in High-Performance Computing (HPC)**

RISC-V, traditionally seen as a lightweight architecture, is now entering the HPC domain. SHD Group highlights advancements in out-of-order core designs and custom extensions, which could make RISC-V competitive with x86 and ARM in server and AI workloads by 2028.

The report underscores the role of companies like **Tenstorrent** and other RISC-V players in developing processors tailored for AI and machine learning. With the demand for specialized AI chips surging, RISC-V‚Äôs flexibility gives it a unique edge.

### **3. Increasing Open-Source Ecosystem**

According to SHD Group, the open-source nature of RISC-V will drive innovation in ways traditional architectures cannot match. They project a robust ecosystem of **free and proprietary designs** that will lower the entry barrier for startups and smaller semiconductor companies.

- By 2026, they anticipate a significant increase in RISC-V cores being developed for niche markets, such as **custom SoCs for automotive, robotics, and wearables**.
- Open-source software tools like GCC and LLVM are already supporting RISC-V, and SHD believes this ecosystem will mature rapidly with the introduction of more optimized frameworks.

### **4. Fragmentation Challenges**

While RISC-V‚Äôs modularity is a strength, SHD Group warns that **fragmentation** could slow adoption. Unlike ARM, which offers a cohesive ecosystem, RISC-V allows companies to add proprietary extensions, leading to incompatibilities between implementations.

SHD emphasizes the need for RISC-V International to create stricter guidelines and standardized profiles (like the **RVA profiles**) to ensure interoperability across implementations.

### **5. Expanding Into Consumer Electronics**

Perhaps the boldest prediction from the SHD Group is that RISC-V will power a significant portion of consumer electronics by 2035. This includes:

- **Smartphones**: With profiles like RVA23 targeting Android, SHD expects RISC-V to start appearing in budget and mid-tier smartphones within the next few years.
- **Smart TVs and Wearables**: SHD highlights RISC-V‚Äôs suitability for these markets due to its energy efficiency and scalability.

### **6. Geopolitical Implications**

The SHD Group report also touches on geopolitics, emphasizing how RISC-V's open nature allows countries to avoid reliance on foreign IP. This is particularly relevant in regions like:

- **China**: With a strong push for semiconductor independence, Chinese firms like Alibaba and Loongson are heavily investing in RISC-V.
- **India**: The government‚Äôs ‚ÄúDigital India‚Äù initiative includes support for RISC-V development, focusing on building a domestic semiconductor ecosystem.
