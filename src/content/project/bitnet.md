An attempt to implement the [bitnet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453) on the GPT. Built on top of [NanoGPT]() in pyTorch.
It also contains implementation of [The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764).

I've not been able to train it on a large scale yet!!.
