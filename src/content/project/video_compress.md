A simple web app to convert videos from H.264 to H.265 encoding, significantly reducing file size while maintaining quality.

## Why H.265?

H.265 (HEVC) is the successor to H.264 (AVC). It offers better compression, allowing for smaller file sizes or higher quality at the same bitrate. This project uses FFmpeg to convert videos from H.264 to H.265.
