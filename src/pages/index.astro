  <p>
    I'm interested in the <strong>design of intelligent systems</strong> — from the inner workings of <strong>SoCs</strong> and <em>RISC-V</em>-based architectures to
    <strong>machine learning algorithms</strong> that shape how systems perceive and adapt.
  </p>

  <p>
    I explore how <strong>hardware meets cognition</strong>: how low-level components interact with learning systems. I often take part in <strong>drone competitions</strong> in Turkey — not for the drones themselves, but for the systems design challenges they bring.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm deeply curious about modern ML — reading papers on <strong>language models</strong>, <strong>diffusion models</strong>, and <strong> NeRF / Gaussian Splatting</strong>. I may not always have the compute to build them, but the ideas alone fascinate me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every few months, I turn some thread of curiosity into a project — web, CLI, desktop, or mobile — often as a way to give shape to something I've learned. You can find most of them on my <a href="https://github.com/amar-jay">GitHub (amar-jay)</a>.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
    I care about <strong>decision-making under uncertainty</strong>, <strong>systems thinking</strong>, and tools that make people <strong>smarter, faster, freer</strong>. Less about academic formality — more about real systems, ideas that click, and abstractions that scale.
  </p> -->

  <p>
		<strong>Simply put:</strong> 
		From what I know about myself, I’m drawn to things most people avoid—not because they’re impossible, but because they require curiosity and patience. I don’t chase them because I already understand them; I chase them because I don’t. Sometimes I try to build what seems out of reach, and other times I focus on just understanding it. Either way, that’s how I learn and that's who I am.

    I'm deeply fascinated by the <strong>architecture and design of intelligent systems</strong> — from the
    <strong>microarchitectural details of SoCs</strong> and custom silicon to the <strong>algorithms that breathe life into perception and learning</strong>.
    My curiosity spans <strong>low-level hardware design</strong> (with a focus on <em>RISC-V</em> and open-source toolchains),
    <strong>embedded systems</strong>, and how these foundational layers interact with <strong>neural computation</strong> and <strong>adaptive systems</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I explore the <strong>intersections of hardware and cognition</strong>, building systems that not only <em>sense</em> the world but <em>adapt</em> to it.
    While I regularly participate in <strong>drone competitions</strong> — which are especially prevalent in Turkey —
    it's the engineering and systems integration behind them that excites me, not the drones themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m constantly drawn to cutting-edge ML research, reading papers on <strong>language models</strong>,
    <strong>diffusion models</strong>, and novel techniques like <strong>Gaussian Splatting</strong> and <strong>NeRF</strong> —
    not always with the resources or full grasp to implement them, but always with genuine curiosity.
    Occasionally, that interest turns into tangible side projects: every few months, I build and release something —
    web, mobile, CLI, or desktop — as a way to apply what I've been exploring.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
    Beyond engineering, I care deeply about <strong>systems thinking</strong>, <strong>decision-making under uncertainty</strong>,
    and building tools or environments that make people <strong>smarter, faster, and freer</strong>.
    I'm less interested in academic formalism for its own sake — more in how ideas manifest into working systems,
    how abstractions touch the real world, and how theory becomes structure.
  </p> -->

  <!-- <p>
    At heart, I’m drawn to systems — how things work, how they break, and how they can be made to learn.
    Whether it’s designing processors, building tools, or exploring the inner mechanics of intelligence,
    I care about the <em>principles</em> that unify hardware, algorithms, and real-world behavior.
    I'm especially interested in ideas that lie at the edge of disciplines — where engineering meets cognition,
    where code becomes structure, and where abstraction gives rise to emergence.
