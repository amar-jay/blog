				My name is <b>Abdel Manan (a.k.a. Manan / amar jay)</b>. I'm an amateur engineer, a
				self-proclaimed researcher and an almost-retired student. I'm a curious person who likes to
				tinker with stuff, be it in the field of computer vision, experimenting with alternative ML
				architectures like Mojo or Tenstorrent, or trying to replicate acclaimed papers. I just like
				to play with and around these technologies and understand the intuition behind them. I've
				also worked in and out of real-time communication pipelines. Specifically, is working in
				robotics that is in conjuction with a flight stack or mapping and navigation. One thing to
				note is I hate ROS and try my best to avoid it; we have a history.
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, I'm working, learning, and researching in and around the Zephyr Project. I hope
				that <b>by mid-2026</b>, I will be thoroughly comfortable using it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of this field, I have a great fascination with finance. Though my knowledge is
				currently limited, I hope to get my hands dirty with it in the future. Mm, that's basically
				all about me. In case I do anything interesting, I'll document it here on my blog. Anything
				else will be on GitHub (if it's code, of course).

    I'm deeply fascinated by the <strong>architecture and design of intelligent systems</strong> — from the
    <strong>microarchitectural details of SoCs</strong> and custom silicon to the <strong>algorithms that breathe life into perception and learning</strong>.
    My curiosity spans <strong>low-level hardware design</strong> (with a focus on <em>RISC-V</em> and open-source toolchains),
    <strong>embedded systems</strong>, and how these foundational layers interact with <strong>neural computation</strong> and <strong>adaptive systems</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I explore the <strong>intersections of hardware and cognition</strong>, building systems that not only <em>sense</em> the world but <em>adapt</em> to it.
    While I regularly participate in <strong>drone competitions</strong> — which are especially prevalent in Turkey —
    it's the engineering and systems integration behind them that excites me, not the drones themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m constantly drawn to cutting-edge ML research, reading papers on <strong>language models</strong>,
    <strong>diffusion models</strong>, and novel techniques like <strong>Gaussian Splatting</strong> and <strong>NeRF</strong> —
    not always with the resources or full grasp to implement them, but always with genuine curiosity.
    Occasionally, that interest turns into tangible side projects: every few months, I build and release something —
    web, mobile, CLI, or desktop — as a way to apply what I've been exploring.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
    Beyond engineering, I care deeply about <strong>systems thinking</strong>, <strong>decision-making under uncertainty</strong>,
    and building tools or environments that make people <strong>smarter, faster, and freer</strong>.
    I'm less interested in academic formalism for its own sake — more in how ideas manifest into working systems,
    how abstractions touch the real world, and how theory becomes structure.
  </p> -->

			<!-- <p>
    At heart, I’m drawn to systems — how things work, how they break, and how they can be made to learn.
    Whether it’s designing processors, building tools, or exploring the inner mechanics of intelligence,
    I care about the <em>principles</em> that unify hardware, algorithms, and real-world behavior.
    I'm especially interested in ideas that lie at the edge of disciplines — where engineering meets cognition,
    where code becomes structure, and where abstraction gives rise to emergence.
