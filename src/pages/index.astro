				My name is <b>Abdel Manan (a.k.a. Manan / amar jay)</b>. I'm an amateur engineer, self-proclaimed researcher, and almost-retired student. I'm curious and love tinkering with computer vision, alternative ML architectures, and replicating papers to grasp the intuition. I've worked on real-time communication pipelines (WebRTC, etc.) and robotics with flight stacks and navigation. One thing: I hate ROS; we have history.
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, I'm deeply immersed in the Zephyr Project, dedicating my efforts to hands-on work, continuous learning, and in-depth research. 
				My goal is to reach full proficiency in it by mid-2026.
			</p>

			<p>
				Outside of this field, I'm into business history—the ups and downs of companies and industries, and the decisions that shape markets. Supply chain dynamics and assembly line strategies fascinate me. I also keep tabs on market trends; they give me a snapshot of the world and help guide my career.

    I'm deeply fascinated by the <strong>architecture and design of intelligent systems</strong> — from the
    <strong>microarchitectural details of SoCs</strong> and custom silicon to the <strong>algorithms that breathe life into perception and learning</strong>.
    My curiosity spans <strong>low-level hardware design</strong> (with a focus on <em>RISC-V</em> and open-source toolchains),
    <strong>embedded systems</strong>, and how these foundational layers interact with <strong>neural computation</strong> and <strong>adaptive systems</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I explore the <strong>intersections of hardware and cognition</strong>, building systems that not only <em>sense</em> the world but <em>adapt</em> to it.
    While I regularly participate in <strong>drone competitions</strong> — which are especially prevalent in Turkey —
    it's the engineering and systems integration behind them that excites me, not the drones themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m constantly drawn to cutting-edge ML research, reading papers on <strong>language models</strong>,
    <strong>diffusion models</strong>, and novel techniques like <strong>Gaussian Splatting</strong> and <strong>NeRF</strong> —
    not always with the resources or full grasp to implement them, but always with genuine curiosity.
    Occasionally, that interest turns into tangible side projects: every few months, I build and release something —
    web, mobile, CLI, or desktop — as a way to apply what I've been exploring.
  </p>

  <!-- <p>
    Beyond engineering, I care deeply about <strong>systems thinking</strong>, <strong>decision-making under uncertainty</strong>,
    and building tools or environments that make people <strong>smarter, faster, and freer</strong>.
    I'm less interested in academic formalism for its own sake — more in how ideas manifest into working systems,
    how abstractions touch the real world, and how theory becomes structure.
  </p> -->

			<!-- <p>
    At heart, I’m drawn to systems — how things work, how they break, and how they can be made to learn.
    Whether it’s designing processors, building tools, or exploring the inner mechanics of intelligence,
    I care about the <em>principles</em> that unify hardware, algorithms, and real-world behavior.
    I'm especially interested in ideas that lie at the edge of disciplines — where engineering meets cognition,
    where code becomes structure, and where abstraction gives rise to emergence.
